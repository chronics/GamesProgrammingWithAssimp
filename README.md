# GamesProgrammingWithAssimp

this is my openGL (SDL2/c++/Assimp) engin code for my university work

##Download
to download this repository, open git shell and select a folder to clone to and input the following into the console 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chronics/GamesProgrammingWithAssimp.git
```

this is the base code for my program and will be updated as i work on it. this file will contain the libs, includes and dlls 
for the program and be linked within the solution so they should all work no matter where the project is on a device

### known issues 
the program is set to create a window in both fullscreen and in windowed mode but fullscreen seems to not work but this will 
be fix later, at the moment i want the program to work before i add fucntions like that so i wont be fixing
it any time soon.

the program from 28/2/15 is not complete so it will not run without having more added to it such as the render finction annd or
model loader
